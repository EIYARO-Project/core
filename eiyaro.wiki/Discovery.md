# Node Discovery Protocol

This specification defines the Node Discovery protocol, a Kademlia-like DHT that
stores information about Eiyaro nodes. The Kademlia structure was chosen because it yields a topology of low diameter.

## Node Identities

Every node has a cryptographic identity, a key on the Ed25519. The public
key of the node serves as its identifier or 'node ID'.

The 'distance' between two node IDs is the bitwise exclusive or on the hashes of the
public keys, taken as the number.

```text
distance(n₁, n₂) = keccak256(n₁) XOR keccak256(n₂)
```

## Node Table

Nodes in the Discovery Protocol keep information about other nodes in their neighborhood.
Neighbor nodes are stored in a routing table consisting of 'k-buckets'. For each `0 ≤ i <
256`, every node keeps a k-bucket for nodes of distance between `2i` and `2i+1` from
itself.

The Node Discovery Protocol uses `k = 16`, i.e. every k-bucket contains up to 16 node
entries. The entries are sorted by time last seen — least-recently seen node at the head,
most-recently seen at the tail.

Whenever a new node N₁ is encountered, it can be inserted into the corresponding bucket.
If the bucket contains less than `k` entries N₁ can simply be added as the first entry. If
the bucket already contains `k` entries, the least recently seen node in the bucket, N₂,
needs to be revalidated by sending a ping packet. If no reply is received from N₂ it is
considered dead, removed and N₁ added to the front of the bucket.


## Recursive Lookup

A 'lookup' locates the `k` closest nodes to a node ID.

The lookup initiator starts by picking `α` closest nodes to the target it knows of. The
initiator then sends concurrent FindNode packets to those nodes. `α` is a system-wide
concurrency parameter, such as 3. In the recursive step, the initiator resends FindNode to
nodes it has learned about from previous queries. Of the `k` nodes the initiator has heard
of closest to the target, it picks `α` that it has not yet queried and resends FindNode to
them. Nodes that fail to respond quickly are removed from consideration until and unless
they do respond.

If a round of FindNode queries fails to return a node any closer than the closest already
seen, the initiator resends the find node to all of the `k` closest nodes it has not
already queried. The lookup terminates when the initiator has queried and gotten responses
from the `k` closest nodes it has seen.

## Wire Protocol

Node discovery messages are sent as UDP datagrams. The maximum size of any packet is 1280
bytes.

```text
packet = packet-header || packet-data
```

Every packet starts with a header:

```text
packet-header = hash || signature || packet-type
hash = keccak256(signature || packet-type || packet-data)
signature = sign(packet-type || packet-data)
```

The `hash` exists to make the packet format recognizable when running multiple protocols
on the same UDP port. It serves no other purpose.

Every packet is signed by the node's identity key. The `signature` is encoded as a byte
array of length 65 as the concatenation of the signature values `r`, `s` and the 'recovery
id' `v`.

The `packet-type` is a single byte defining the type of message. Valid packet types are
listed below. Data after the header is specific to the packet type and is encoded as an
RLP list. As per EIP-8, implementations should ignore any additional elements in the list
as well as any extra data after the list.

### Ping Packet (0x01)

```text
packet-data = [version, from, to, expiration]
version = 4
from = [sender-ip, sender-udp-port, sender-tcp-port]
to = [recipient-ip, recipient-udp-port, 0]
```

The `expiration` field is an absolute UNIX time stamp. Packets containing a time stamp
that lies in the past are expired may not be processed.

When a ping packet is received, the recipient should reply with a pong packet. It may also
consider the sender for addition into the node table.

### Pong Packet (0x02)

```text
packet-data = [to, ping-hash, expiration]
```

Pong is the reply to ping.

`ping-hash` should be equal to `hash` of the corresponding ping packet. Implementations
should ignore unsolicited pong packets that do not contain the hash of the most recent
ping packet.

### FindNode Packet (0x03)

```text
packet-data = [target, expiration]
```

A FindNode packet requests information about nodes close to `target`. The `target` is a
Ed25519 public key. When FindNode is received, the recipient should reply with
neighbors packets containing the closest 16 nodes to target found in its local table.


### Neighbors Packet (0x04)

```text
packet-data = [nodes, expiration]
nodes = [[ip, udp-port, tcp-port, node-id], ... ]
```

Neighbors is the reply to FindNode.
