Eiyaro

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Eiyaro/e.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Eiyaro/ey) [![AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20v3-brightgreen.svg)](./LICENSE)

**Official golang implementation of the Eiyaro protocol.**

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary archives are published at https://github.com/Eiyaro/ey/releases.

## What is Eiyaro?

Eiyaro is software designed to operate and connect to highly scalable blockchain networks confirming to the Eiyaro Blockchain Protocol, which allows partipicants to define, issue and transfer digitial assets on a multi-asset shared ledger. Please refer to the [White Paper](https://github.com/Eiyaro/wiki/blob/master/en-US/Eiyaro-Technical-White-Paper-EN.pdf) for more details.

In the current state `eiyaro` is able to:

- Manage key, account as well as asset
- Send transactions, i.e., issue, spend and retire asset

## Installing with Homebrew

```
brew tap eiyaro/eiyaro && brew install eiyaro
```

## Building from source

### Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.8 or higher, with `$GOPATH` set to your preferred directory

### Installation

Ensure Go with the supported version is installed properly:

```bash
$ go version
$ go env GOROOT GOPATH
```

- Get the source code

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Eiyaro/ey.git $GOPATH/src/eiyaro/ey
```

- Build source code

``` bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/eiyaro/ey
$ go mod tidy
$ make eiyarocd    
$ make eiyaroccli  
```

When successfully building the project, the `eiyarod` and `eiyarocli` binary should be present in `cmd/eiyarod` and `cmd/eiyarocli` directory, respectively.

### Executables

The Eiyaro project comes with several executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command      | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **eiyarocd**   | eiyarod command can help to initialize and launch eiyaro domain by custom parameters. `eiyarod --help` for command line options. |
| **eiyaroccli** | Our main Eiyaro CLI client. It is the entry point into the Eiyaro network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node archive node (retaining all historical state). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Eiyaro network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `eiyarocli --help` and the [eiyaroccli API page](https://github.com/EIYARO/ey/blob/main/API-Reference.md) for command line options. |

## Running eiyaro

Currently, eiyaro is still in active development and a ton of work needs to be done, but we also provide the following content for these eager to do something with `eiyaro`. This section won't cover all the commands of `eiyarod` and `eiyarocli` at length, for more information, please the help of every command, e.g., `eiyarocli help`.

### Initialize

First of all, initialize the node:

```bash
$ cd /src/eiyaro/ey/cmd/eiyarod
$ go build
$ ./eiyarod init --chain_id mainnet

```

There are three options for the flag `--chain_id`:

- `mainnet`: connect to the mainnet.
- `testnet`: connect to the testnet wisdom.
- `solonet`: standalone mode.

After that, you'll see `config.toml` generated, then launch the node.

### launch

``` bash
$ nohup ./eiyarod node &

```

available flags for `eiyarod node`:

Given the `eiyarod` node is running, the general workflow is as follows:

- create key, then you can create account and asset.
- send transaction, i.e., build, sign and submit transaction.
- query all kinds of information, let's say, avaliable key, account, key, balances, transactions, etc.

__simd feature:__

You could enable the _simd_ feature to speed up the _PoW_ verification (e.g., during mining and block verification) by simply:
```
eiyarod node --simd.enable
```

To enable this feature you will need to compile from the source code by yourself, and `make eiyarod-simd`. 

What is more,

+ if you are using _Mac_, please make sure _llvm_ is installed by `brew install llvm`.
+ if you are using _Windows_, please make sure _mingw-w64_ is installed and set up the _PATH_ environment variable accordingly.

For more details about using `eiyarocli` command please refer to [API Reference](https://github.com/EIYARO/ey/blob/main/API-Reference.md)
